## Check out the Game!
The user first encounters the main loading screen of Keyboard Smasher after loading up the app. There are plenty of short cuts avaiable (click "H" to open up the shortcuts menu), or a user can select from "Select Level", "Instructions", or the Scores pages.

Lets play a game! There are many preloaded levels built into Keyboard Smasher, so all a user needs to do is select one that sounds interesting to them, and play away! If the user needs to quit a game at any point, "Q" can be selected to force end the game and return to menu.

After the game, the user will receive a score breakdown. A grid shows the progression of combo (black line) and score (blue line) over the course of the game. The max combo a player can reach is 4, and whenver a combo is broken, the black line will plummet down to 0 again. Users have the option to go Save their score to the high scores list, replay, select another level, or head to the settings page. Clicking "M" will return the user to the menu page.

One of the coolest part of this game is that a user can create their own level by clicking "C" on the Select Level page. Just input a music file and once the user starts the song, they can punch out beat patterns to the song as it plays (sadly, gifs cant play sound!). The user can see their patterns on the screen as the arrows light up. When done, click "S" and you can see your new game in the levels list!

And finally, if the user is feeling like changing things up, they can access the Settings page by hitting "E". There, they have the chance to change arrow speed, shape, direction, the keybindings associated with each arrow, and a background image if they so choose!
